            <p>Welcome to the help page for <span style="color:#29ABE2">Join</span>, your guide to using our kanban
                project management tool.
                Here, we'll provide an overview of what <span style="color:#29ABE2">Join</span> is, how it can
                benefit you, and how to use it.</p>
            <h2>What is Join?</h2>
            <p><span style="color:#29ABE2">Join</span> is a kanban-based project management tool designed and built by a
                group of dedicated students as part of their web development bootcamp at the Developer
                Akademie.<br><br>

                Kanban, a Japanese term meaning "billboard", is a highly effective method to visualize work, limit
                work-in-progress, and maximize efficiency (or flow).
                <span style="color:#29ABE2">Join</span> leverages the principles of kanban to help users manage their
                tasks and projects in an intuitive, visual interface.<br><br>

                It is important to note that <span style="color:#29ABE2">Join</span> is designed as an educational
                exercise and is not intended for extensive business usage.

                While we strive to ensure the best possible user experience, we cannot guarantee consistent
                availability, reliability, accuracy, or other aspects of quality regarding <span
                    style="color:#29ABE2">Join</span>.
            </p>
            <h2>How to use it</h2>
            <p>Here is a step-by-step guide on how to use <span style="color:#29ABE2">Join</span>:</p>
        </div>
        <div class="text_line">
            <div style="display: flex;">
                <h2 class="number">1.</h2>
                <h2 class="underline">Exploring the Board</h2>
            </div>
            <p>When you log in to <span style="color:#29ABE2">Join</span>, you'll find a default
                board. This board
                represents your project and contains four default lists: "To Do", "In Progress", “Await feedback”
                and "Done".</p>

            <div style="display: flex;">
                <h2 class="number">2.</h2>
                <h2 class="underline">Creating Contacts</h2>
            </div>
            <p>In <span style="color:#29ABE2">Join</span>, you can add contacts to collaborate on your projects. Go
                to the "Contacts" section, click
                on "New contact", and fill in
                the required information. Once added, these contacts can be assigned tasks and they can interact
                with the tasks on the board.</p>

            <div style="display: flex;">
                <h2 class="number">3.</h2>
                <h2 class="underline">Adding Cards</h2>
            </div>
            <p>Now that you've added your contacts, you can start adding cards.
                Cards represent individual tasks. Click the "+" button under the appropriate list to create a new
                card.
                Fill in the task details in the card, like task name, description, due date, assignees, etc.</p>
            <div style="display: flex;">
                <h2 class="number">4.</h2>
                <h2 class="underline">Moving Cards</h2>
            </div>
            <p>As the task moves from one stage to another, you can reflect that on the board by dragging and
                dropping the card from one
                list to another.</p>
            <div style="display: flex;">
                <h2 class="number">5.</h2>
                <h2 class="underline">Deleting Cards</h2>
            </div>
            <p>Once a Task is completed, you can either move it to the 'Done' list or delete it. Deleting a card will
                permanently remove it from 
                the board. Please exercise caution when deleting cards, as this action is irreversible.</p>
            <p>Remember that using <span style="color:#29ABE2">Join</span> effectively requires consistent updates from
                you
                and your team to ensure the board reflects the
                current state of your project</p><br><br>
