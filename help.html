            <p>Welcome to the help page for <span style="color:#29ABE2">Join</span>, your guide to using our kanban
                project management tool.
                Here, we'll provide an overview of what<br> <span style="color:#29ABE2">Join</span> is, how it can
                benefit you, and how to use it.</p>
            <h2>What is Join?</h2>
            <p><span style="color:#29ABE2">Join</span> is a kanban-based project management tool designed and built by a
                group of dedicated students as part of their web<br>development bootcamp at the Developer
                Akademie.<br><br>

                Kanban, a Japanese term meaning "billboard", is a highly effective method to visualize work, limit
                work-in-progress, and maximize<br> efficiency (or flow).
                <span style="color:#29ABE2">Join</span> leverages the principles of kanban to help users manage their
                tasks and projects in an intuitive, visual <br> interface.<br><br>

                It is important to note that <span style="color:#29ABE2">Join</span> is designed as an educational
                exercise and is not intended for extensive business usage.

                While we<br>strive to ensure the best possible user experience, we cannot guarantee consistent
                availability, reliability, accuracy, or other aspects <br> of quality regarding <span
                    style="color:#29ABE2">Join</span>.
            </p>
            <h2>How to use it</h2>
            <p>Here is a step-by-step guide on how to use <span style="color:#29ABE2">Join</span>:</p>
            <div class="text_line">
                <h2>1.Exploring The Board</h2>
                <p>Exploring the Board When you log in to <span style="color:#29ABE2">Join</span>, you'll find a default
                    board. This board
                    represents your project and contains four default lists: "To Do", "In Progress", “Await feedback”
                    and "Done".</p>

                <h2>2.Creating Contacts</h2>
                <p>Creating Contacts
                    In <span style="color:#29ABE2">Join</span>, you can add contacts to collaborate on your projects. Go
                    to the "Contacts" section, click
                    on "New contact", and fill in<br>
                    the required information. Once added, these contacts can be assigned tasks and they can interact
                    with the tasks on the board.</p>

                <h2>3.Adding Cards</h2>
                <p>Adding Cards
                    Now that you've added your contacts, you can start adding cards.
                    Cards represent individual tasks. Click the "+" button under<br>the appropriate list to create a new
                    card.
                    Fill in the task details in the card, like task name, description, due date, assignees, etc.</p>
                <h2>4.Moving Cards</h2>
                <p>Moving Cards
                    As the task moves from one stage to another, you can reflect that on the board by dragging and
                    dropping the card from one<br>
                    list to another.</p>
                <h2>5.Deleting Cards</h2>
                <p>Once a Task is completed, you can either move it to the 'Done' list or delete it. Deleting a card will permanently remove it from <br>
                the board. Please exercise caution when deleting cards, as this action is irreversible.</p>
                <p>Remember that using <span style="color:#29ABE2">Join</span> effectively requires consistent updates from you and your team to ensure the board reflects the<br>
                current state of your project</p>
